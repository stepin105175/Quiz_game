TEST PLAN
Organization of Project involves creating a System Test Plan, Schedule & Test Approach, and assigning responsibilities.Test plan is to find and report as many bugs as possible to improve the integrity of our program. Although exhaustive testing is not possible, we will exercise a broad range of tests to achieve our goal. We will also test the user friendliness of our Project.The project will be used as an important tool, but we would like to ensure that it could be run on a variety of platforms with little impact on performance or usability.
The following represents the overall flow of the testing process:
1.	Identify the requirements to be tested. All test cases shall be derived using the current Program Specification.
2.	Identify which particular test(s) will be used to test each module.
3.	Review the test data and test cases to ensure that the unit has been thoroughly verified and that the test data and test cases are adequate to verify proper operation of the unit.
4.	Identify the expected results for each test.
5.	Document the test case configuration, test data, and expected results.
